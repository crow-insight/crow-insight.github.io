The [Region V Public Health Training Center](https://www.rvphtc.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"} (RVPHTC) receives funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help ensure that staff of the hundreds of public health agencies in the Midwest have the skills to address existing and emerging health problems. As COVID-19 cases were growing in spring 2020, Crow Insight helped RVPHTC expedite the release of findings from a region-wide survey of agency training needs. The [suite of three dashboards](https://www.rvphtc.org/training-needs-assessment/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"} was implemented cost-effectively by combining Tableau Public with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
