The **Region V Public Health Training Center**, based at the University of Michigan, asked Crow Insight to develop a dashboard to expedite the release of data from a survey of Midwestern public health agencies. We created three dashboards: one summarizing workforce skill gaps, another breaking down each skill into its components, with results by state and agency type and size, and a third showing what types of organizations are providing the bulk of training.
