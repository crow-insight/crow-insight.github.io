The [Region V Public Health Training Center](https://www.rvphtc.org/) (RVPHTC) receives funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help ensure that staff of the hundreds of public health agencies in the Midwest have the skills to address existing and emerging health problems. For RVPHTC, as COVID-19 cases were growing in spring 2020, Crow Insight helped expedite the release findings from a region-wide survey of agency training needs in core strategic areas. The [suite of three dashboards](https://www.rvphtc.org/training-needs-assessment/) was implemented cost-effectively by combining Tableau Public with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
