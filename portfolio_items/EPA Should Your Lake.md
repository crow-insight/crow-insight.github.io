We believe that good information design starts with a pithy message, not numbers inside donut charts.

**EPA's** National Aquatic Resources Surveys team wanted infographics to include in tweets and blog posts, to share a key data point and provide a call to action and a way to learn more. We collaborated with them to develop those messages into something new:  visually compelling infograms focused on tight text and photos, rather than clip art and pie graphs.
