As part of our support for EPA's National Aquatic Resources Survey, we adapted our National Lakes Assessment dashboard for use with the [National Coastal Condition Assessment](coastalcondition.epa.gov), finalized in 2016. The landing page of the dashboard lets users view the percentage of coastal area in good, fair or poor condition for the most recent coastal survey, as well as change over time. Users can compare subpopulation data to confidence intervals for the national data set. This dashboard was built with JavaScript and D3.js.
