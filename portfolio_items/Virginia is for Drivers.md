Crow Insight helped the [Virginia Department of Transportation](https://www.virginiadot.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"} (VDOT) re-imagine its web-based dashboard for sharing data from a citizen satisfaction survey.

It focused on positive responses but let users drill down to discover more response data and regional differences. VDOT's original dashboard had relied on poorly suited pie charts that weren't accessible for color-blind users and on an unwieldy interface that discouraged interaction and pattern discovery.
