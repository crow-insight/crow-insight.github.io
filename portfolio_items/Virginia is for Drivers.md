Crow Insight helped the **Virginia Department of Transportation** re-imagine its presentation of data.from a survey on VDOT performance. Previously, VDOT used a pie chart dashboard that was unwieldy and took a long time to read.

The new dashboard played on a familiar Virginia slogan to attract users and allowed comparison of multiple measures simultaneously. It focused on positive responses but let users drill down for more response data and regional differences.
