Every year, U.S. EPA conducts complex field surveys to evaluate environmental quality in the nation’s water bodies. Crow Insight helps EPA’s Office of Water explain its findings to multiple audiences.

This figure, from a 2016 report, explains how EPA determines the percentage of lakes in poor condition. Thoughtfully re-invented descriptions like this help technical audiences interpret and act upon scientific data.
