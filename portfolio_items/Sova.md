[Sova Solutions](https://sova.org/) guides universities through important strategic changes. Sova's process kicks off with an opinion survey of hundreds or thousands of stakeholders. The results inform Sova's written recommendations to university leaders. Sova asked Crow Insight to speed up the process and create better-looking reports, because Sova staff had been tediously cobbling together default Qualtrics' graphs with Sova's own findings. Our web-based solution now enables them to quickly deliver beautiful, [customizable reports](/assets/sova_climate_scan_report_2020-07-10_12-21-49_for_portfolio.pdf) for each client. Sova now has more time to analyze results and can start leadership discussions more quickly.
