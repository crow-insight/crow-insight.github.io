For **Sova Solutions**, an education consulting firm, Crow Insight developed an automated reporting system to provide customized survey results to respondents (community colleges). Previously, Sova staff had used Qualtricsâ€™ default reports, but they wanted more flexibility in chart and report design. Our solution allowed for boilerplate text populated dynamically with survey data and different charts for each type of survey question. It also included a mechanism allowing Sova to select salient open-ended survey responses for inclusion in the report.
