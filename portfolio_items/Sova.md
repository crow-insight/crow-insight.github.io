[Sova Solutions](https://sova.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"} guides universities through important strategic changes. Sova's process kicks off with an opinion survey of hundreds or thousands of stakeholders. The results inform Sova's written recommendations to university leaders. Sova asked Crow Insight to speed up the reporting process and create better-looking charts, because Sova staff had been tediously cobbling together basic graphs from Qualtrics, their online survey platform. Our integrated web-based solution now enables them to quickly deliver beautiful, [customizable reports](/assets/pdfs/sova_climate_scan_sample_report_excerpts.pdf) for each client. Sova now has more time to analyze results and can start leadership discussions more quickly.
