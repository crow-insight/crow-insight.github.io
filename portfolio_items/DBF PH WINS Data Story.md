We all now appreciate the work of public health professionals. But itâ€™s more urgent than ever that the public understands what these workers need in order to be effective and achieve job satisfaction. Early in the pandemic, Crow Insight worked with the de Beaumont Foundation to create an [interactive data story](https://www.debeaumont.org/phwins-signup/ph-wins-explore-the-data/) that helps policymakers and the public deeply explore the demographics and opinions of staff at state and local health agencies. Creating a compelling product required us to push Tableau Public beyond its normal limits. To learn more, check out [our talk](https://youtu.be/u_iayFA9XuA?t=2914) to a Tableau User Group.
