Crow Insight transformed the [Combined Federal Campaign](https://www.opm.gov/combined-federal-campaign/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"} (CFC) Charity Search Tool in order to promote giving. The CFC enables federal workers to make charitable donations through payroll deductions, but workers face an overwhelming choice of more than 1,000 charities. This tool allows users to narrow their search.
The cheerful headers in this dashboard invite users to get started, while tooltips and hyperlinks help them quickly get more information about their top candidates.
