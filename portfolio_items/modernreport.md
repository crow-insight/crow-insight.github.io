A clean and polished layout accentuates key messages and makes a report more readable. Crow Insight’s design of U.S. EPA’s National Lakes Assessment (NLA) report focuses attention on the stars of the show: the science and the data.

Our other award-winning NLA work does the same: infographics, exploratory dashboards, and methodological explanations. The circular and wave motifs on the cover of the report (below) are reinforced in other National Lakes Assessment documents, as well.
