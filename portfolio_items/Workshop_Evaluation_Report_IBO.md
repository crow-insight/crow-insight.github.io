Many associations collect participant feedback after conference sessions and training workshops but face the subsequent, daunting challenge of effectively analyzing and sharing the survey responses from thousands of participants. For a member organization focused on secondary education, Crow Insight developed a proof-of-concept for quickly ingesting survey data files (such as those from Qualtrics) and producing polished and informative [reports](/assets/pdfs/workshop_evaluation_survey_sample_report.pdf) for the leaders of workshops and conference sessions. This effort is the forerunner to similar projects for [Sova](../Sova_ClimateScan_Report) and the [Center for First-Generation Student Success](../NASPA_ITRS).
