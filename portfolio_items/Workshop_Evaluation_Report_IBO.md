Many associations collect participant feedback after conference sessions and training workshops but face the subsequent, daunting challenge of effectively analyzing and sharing the survey responses from thousands of participants. For a member organization focused on secondary education, Crow Insight developed a proof-of-concept for quickly ingesting survey data files (such as those from Qualtrics) and producing polished and informative reports for the leaders of workshops and conference sessions. The [sample report](/assets/pdfs/workshop_evaluation_survey_sample_report.pdf) we prepared is the forerunner to a survey report we developed for [Sova Solutions](../sova-climate-scan-report).
