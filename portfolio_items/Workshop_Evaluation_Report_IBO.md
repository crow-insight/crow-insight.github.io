Many associations collect participant feedback after conference sessions and training workshops, but face a subsequent, daunting challenge of effectively analyzing and sharing the survey results from thousands of participants afterward. For a member organization focused on secondary education, Crow Insight developed a-proof-of-concept for quickly ingesting survey data files (such as those from Qualtrics) and producing polished and informative [reports](/assets/pdfs/ibo report 2020_03_11.pdf) for the leaders of workshops and conference sessions. This effort is the forerunner to similar projects for [Sova](../Sova_ClimateScan_Report) and the [Center for First-Generation Student Success](../NASPA_ITRS).
