There is no single "right" graph for survey data. It depends upon the data, the audience, the context and the point being made. A university asked Crow Insight to create a suite of visuals to publicly describe the success of a re-branding campaign that had generated substantial discussion (and some opposition) among stakeholders. We amplified the key message for the presentation slide shown here by highlighting and annotating the most important data in the graph, to ensure the audience wouldn't miss the speaker's point.
