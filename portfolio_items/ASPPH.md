The [Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health](https://www.aspph.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"} had always prepared customized reports for its members upon request, but those requests tended to be very time-consuming and duplicative. To make efficient use of internal staff time, ASPPH asked us to create a suite of dashboards allowing members to do their own analyses of trends in public health education.
<br><br>
Our design lets members select their own peer group and analyze a wide variety of data using multiple graphs and filters. In the example, data for the userâ€™s institution is in red, with that of selected peers in blue.  These dashboards became a key building block of ASPPH's member data center, where members now can create reports to meet almost all their needs.
