The **Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health** has always prepared customized reports for its members upon request. To make efficient use of limited resources, ASPPH asked us to create a dashboard allowing members to do their own analyses of trends in public health education.

Our design employed careful color usage, multiple graphs, and filters. In the example, data for the userâ€™s institution is in red, with that of selected peers in blue.
