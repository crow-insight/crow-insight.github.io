The **Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health** has always prepared customized reports for its members upon request. To make efficient use of limited resources, ASPPH asked us to create a suite of dashboards allowing members to do their own analyses of trends in public health education.

Our design lets members select their own peer group and analyze a wide variety of data using multiple graphs and filters. In the example, data for the userâ€™s institution is in red, with that of selected peers in blue.
