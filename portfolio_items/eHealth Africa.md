During the West African Ebola crisis, responders like [eHealth Africa](https://www.ehealthafrica.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"} needed fast access to public health data. We provided remote training and designed dashboards that enabled managers and staff alike to better analyze and respond to trends in their Ebola call centers and other operations.  
<br>
Visualizations like this map helped eHealth Africa analyze hotline call volume, communicate with partners and donors, and re-allocate resources. The orange dots represent the number of alert calls, while the shading indicates the number of calls per 5,000 people.
