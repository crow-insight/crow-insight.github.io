During the West African Ebola crisis, responders like **eHealth Africa** needed fast access to public health data. We designed a dashboard that enabled managers to better analyze and respond to Ebola call center trends.

Visualizations like this map helped eHealth Africa analyze hotline call volume, communicate with partners and donors, and re-allocate resources. The orange dots represent the number of alert calls, while the shading indicates the number of calls per 5,000 people.
