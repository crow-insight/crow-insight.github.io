A clean and polished layout accentuates key messages and draws in readers. Our design for **U.S. EPAâ€™s** National Lakes Assessment report focuses attention on the stars of the show: the science and the data. Our other award-winning NLA work does the same: [infographics](https://www.crowinsight.com/xxxxx), [exploratory dashboards](https://www.crowinsight.com/EPA_dashboard), and [methodological explanations](https://www.crowinsight.com/xxxx).
