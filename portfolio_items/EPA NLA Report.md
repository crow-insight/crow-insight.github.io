A clean and polished layout accentuates key messages and draws in readers. Our design for **U.S. EPAâ€™s** National Lakes Assessment report focuses attention on the stars of the show: the science and the data. Our other award-winning NLA work does the same: [infographics](../EPA_should_your_lake), [exploratory dashboards](../EPA_dashboard/), and [methodological explanations](../EPA_reference_site).
