A clean and polished layout accentuates key messages and draws in readers. Our design for [U.S. EPAâ€™s National Lakes Assessment](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/nla){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"} report focuses attention on the stars of the show: the science and the data. Our other award-winning NLA work does the same: [infographics](../epa-should-your-lake), [exploratory dashboards](../epa-dashboard/), and [methodological explanations](../epa-reference-site).
