Crow Insight developed this explanatory graphic to explain how field sampling was conducted for the National Rivers and Streams Assessment report. [EPAâ€™s Office of Water](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-water){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"} wanted its reports to be accessible to a wider audience, so we worked with EPA staff to simplify the protocols described in EPA field manuals down to their essence. We drafted text, developed custom illustrations of the sampling reach, and designed a layout to present the information logically and in an easily read format, consistent with the design of the report as a whole.
