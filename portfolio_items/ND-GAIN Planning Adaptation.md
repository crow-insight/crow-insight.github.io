Crow Insight designed an interactive visualization dashboard prototype for the **Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index** that will help city planners assess how prepared they are to address climate hazards and compare themselves to other cities, based on socioeconomic factors, building stock, institutional capacity, and other factors. The tool illuminates an otherwise opaque and complex methodology, providing essential transparency for an issue that may require substantial sacrifice and commitment from stakeholders.
