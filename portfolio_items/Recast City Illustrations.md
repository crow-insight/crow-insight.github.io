Ilana Preuss of [Recast City](https://www.recastcity.com/) has a mission: helping community leaders across the U.S. create robust, lasting and inclusive economic growth by investing in local people who make things. For her forthcoming Kindle [book](https://islandpress.org/books/recast-your-city), Crow Insight created illustrations of bakeries, breweries and other businesses to help readers envision new uses for downtown buildings left empty by economic change.
