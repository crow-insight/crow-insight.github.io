Ilana Preuss of [Recast City](https://www.recastcity.com/) has a mission: helping community leaders across the U.S. create robust, lasting inclusive economic growth by investing in local people who make things. For her forthcoming Kindle book, Crow Insight created illustrations of bakeries, breweries and other businesses to help readers envision new uses for downtown buildings left empty by economic change.
