As part of our award-winning support for [U.S. EPAâ€™s Office of Water](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-water){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"}, we built a suite of highly customized dashboards for the National Lakes Assessment. The matrix dashboard shown here enables technical partners to identify potential patterns across a large number of ecological regions and indicators. Other [dashboard](https://nationallakesassessment.epa.gov/) views let users drill in to make more precise comparisons while respecting statistical uncertainty.

Crow Insight also helped EPA with [social media shareable graphics](../epa-should-your-lake), [reporting](../epa-modern-report-design), and [methodological explanations](../epa-reference-site) for this assessment, and has continued to developing innovative reporting solutions over several years.
