As part of our award-winning support for **U.S. EPAâ€™s Office of Water**, we built a series of highly customized dashboards for the National Lakes Assessment, using D3.js. Crow Insight has also helped EPA with [social media shareable graphics](../epa-should-your-lake), [reporting](../epa-modern-report-design), and [methodological explanations](../epa-reference-site) for the assessment. The [dashboard](https://nationallakesassessment.epa.gov/) lets users look for broad patterns across ecological indicators and regions. Other views allow more precise comparisons, while still reflecting statistical uncertainty.
