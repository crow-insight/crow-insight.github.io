As part of our award-winning support for **U.S. EPAâ€™s Office of Water**, we built a series of highly customized dashboards for the National Lakes Assessment, using JavaScript and D3.js. Crow Insight has also helped EPA with [social media shareable graphics](https://www.crowinsight.com/EPA_should_your_lake), [reporting](https://www.crowinsight.com/EPA_modern_report_design), and [methodological explanations](https://www.crowinsight.com/EPA_reference_site) for the assessment. The dashboard below lets users look for broad patterns across ecological indicators and regions. Other views allow more precise comparisons, while still reflecting statistical uncertainty.
