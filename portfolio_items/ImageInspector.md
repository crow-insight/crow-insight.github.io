In support of our suite of dashboards for [U.S. EPAâ€™s Office of Water](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-water){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"}, we developed a visual regression testing tool in Python to improve and automate the dashboard validation process. Built using Python's webbot library, the tool compares screenshots of over 15,000 unique visual states and presents visual discrepancies for further evaluation.
