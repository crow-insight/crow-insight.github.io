[Achieving the Dream](https://www.achievingthedream.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"} (ATD) partners with community colleges to design and share innovative programs (interventions) that can improve student success. ATD asked Crow Insight to develop a visual interface for its Interventions Showcase. The new Showcase summarized the hundreds of interventions conducted, helped colleges discover new ideas that might be useful and enabled users to connect with peers that implemented those programs. After launch, the Showcase quickly became the most popular page on ATD's website.

We recommended the “tree map” format for this content exploration tool because it is intuitive and can accommodate large numbers of categories. Tree maps limit our ability to visually compare exact quantities, but such comparisons were not a priority here.
