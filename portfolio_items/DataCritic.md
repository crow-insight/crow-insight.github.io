In support of our suite of dashboards and reports for [U.S. EPAâ€™s Office of Water](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-water){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"}, Crow Insight developed a structured data testing tool in R Shiny. Due to the complex stratified sample design of the National Aquatic Resource Surveys, accurate and efficient data testing was essential in ensuring the integrity of data presented in dashboards, reports, and infographics. Our tool verified data model shape and accuracy, and displayed flagged issues in a flexible format that allowed our EPA partners to identify and address errors in the data.
