The [Center for First-Generation Student Success](https://firstgen.naspa.org/) at [NASPA](https://www.naspa.org/) helps member institutions identify, implement and measure strategies that advance first-generation student success. To glean insights, the Center analyzes thousands of survey response items. We created the Insights Tool Reporting System to enable the Center's staff to easily analyze data and create benchmarking [reports](/assets/ITRS-Benchmarking-Report-Sample.pdf) and [presentations](/assets/ITRS-Benchmarking-Presentation-Sample.pdf) for each institution, consistent with the Center's branding guides and document templates.
