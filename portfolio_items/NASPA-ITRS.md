The [Center for First-generation Student Success](https://firstgen.naspa.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"}, an initiative of [NASPA](https://www.naspa.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow noopener"}, assists participating "First Scholars" institutions in identifying, implementing and measuring strategies that advance first-generation student success at colleges and universities. To glean insights, the Center analyzes thousands of responses to survey questions. Crow Insight created the Insights Tool Reporting System to enable the Center's staff to easily analyze data and create benchmarking [reports](/assets/pdfs/ITRS-Benchmarking-Report-Sample.pdf) and [presentations](/assets/pdfs/ITRS-Benchmarking-Presentation-Sample.pdf) for each institution, consistent with the Center's branding guides and document templates.
