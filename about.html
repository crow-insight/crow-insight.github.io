      <p>Crow Insight was founded in 2014 to help organizations aiming to make a lasting impact on the world. Our founder Mike Crow had been working in program development and evaluation, helping agencies set goals and develop key performance indicators. He knew these organizations could make better decisions and more easily share their stories if they knew how to visualize and convey their data, and he knew he could help them. Since our founding, we've grown into a small multidisciplinary team with remote offices around the United States. </p>
