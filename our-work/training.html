excerpt: "Mike Crow, our founder, has designed and leads a variety of workshops in data visualization and communication. He regularly updates the content based on what we've learned in our research and practice, and he tailors each session to meet the client's needs.  The sessions range from a couple of hours to a couple of days, and work well in both virtual and in-person settings."

            <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn how and why data visualization can help you analyze your data more quickly and deeply. You’ll learn a framework for visualization, the Power-Up model, which places essential data visualization techniques into three groups: preparation, density, and exploration. You’ll explore how the purpose of the visualization should drive the choice of elements to add (or subtract). Through an in-depth case study and several short exercises, you’ll examine real-world examples of graphics and dashboards to understand how the Power-Up techniques can be applied to your data.</p>

                    <p>This workshop is an essential follow-on to our introduction to data visualization, in which you learned how data viz helps you better understand data. In this session, you will learn how to selectively apply those techniques in order to share your findings with an audience. We'll discuss the most important thing you should do before you make a chart, hone in on the most important Power-Ups to consider when communicating data, and point out pitfalls to avoid so you can nail your next data presentation. </p>

            <p>Even when you know the data story you want to tell, it can be challenging to convey it effectively. In this workshop, participants learn a practical and memorable formula for improving how they communicate and present data. In addition, they will learn tips for data presentation that can be applied using common software products like PowerPoint and Excel. Exercises and discussion are integrated throughout the instructional component. Participants engage in individual and group exercises that allow them to practice identifying ways of improving the messaging for the types of data they use.</p>
