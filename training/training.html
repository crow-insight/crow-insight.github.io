excerpt: "Empower your stakeholders and improve your decision making.
Many clients have found training  on data visualization concepts and data communication
to be a helpful complement to their collaboration with us, enabling them to make more informed
decisions about the design of the graphics and tools we create for them. Mike Crow, president of Crow Insight,
leads all trainings. Workshops can be delivered in-person or via webinar."

  <h2> Intro to Advanced Data visualization</h2>

    <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn how and why data visualization can help you analyze your data more quickly and deeply. You’ll learn a framework for visualization, the Power-Up model, which places data visualization techniques into three groups: preparation, data density, and exploration. You’ll explore how the purpose of the visualization should drive the choice of elements to add (or subtract). Through an in-depth case study and several short exercises, you’ll examine real-world examples of graphics and dashboards to understand how the Power-Up techniques can be applied to your data.</p>
