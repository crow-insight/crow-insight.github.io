I"Ò<p>As part of our award-winning support for <strong>U.S. EPAâ€™s Office of Water</strong>, we built a series of highly customized dashboards for the National Lakes Assessment, using JavaScript and D3.js. Crow Insight has also helped EPA with <a href="https://www.crowinsight.com/EPA_should_your_lake">social media shareable graphics</a>, <a href="https://www.crowinsight.com/EPA_modern_report_design">reporting</a>, and <a href="https://www.crowinsight.com/EPA_reference_site">methodological explanations</a> for the assessment. The dashboard below lets users look for broad patterns across ecological indicators and regions. Other views allow more precise comparisons, while still reflecting statistical uncertainty.</p>
