I"è<p>The <strong>Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health</strong> has always prepared customized reports for its members upon request. To make efficient use of limited resources, ASPPH asked us to create a dashboard allowing members to do their own analyses of trends in public health education.</p>

<p>Our design employed careful color usage, multiple graphs, and filters. In the example, data for the userâ€™s institution is in red, with that of selected peers in blue.</p>
