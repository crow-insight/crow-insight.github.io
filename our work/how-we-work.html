      <p>We strive to understand the context, data and communication
        needs for the project. Early on, we begin working with our client
        counterparts to gather the information and resources we need to review.
        This helps us identify essential questions for the requirements process.</p>

      <p>Great performances in sports or theater don’t happen without the team’s
         behind-the-scenes preparation. Making information shine takes a similar commitment.
         Over the course of one or more structured discussions with our client’s team,
        we explain information design principles, inquiring and collaborating to define and prioritize
        requirements of the work. The topics we explore include: the audience, the purpose, design principles,
        products and product-specific requirements.  These requirements serve as a touchstone throughout
        the next phase, guiding the design process and helping us evaluate its success. </p>

      <p>We typically start with sketches to share ideas and generate feedback
         in a timely fashion. Subsequent designs are created using software or
        code – becoming increasingly polished with each iteration.
        Final products are carefully checked for accuracy and adherence to requirements.</p>
