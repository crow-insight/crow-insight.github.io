    <h2>Develop Deeper Understanding</h2>
    <p>We strive to ensure that we have a deep
      understanding of the context, information,
      data and messages that need to be
      communicated. Shortly after project start,
      in preparation for a kickoff meeting, we will
      begin working with the project liaison to
      gather and review all needed information.
      We will identify and communicate essential
      questions to the project liaison and/or the
      project team and experts.</p>

    <h2>Design, Iterate, & Polish</h2>
    <p>Depending upon the design complexity
      involved, each product will involve various
      steps of design, iteration, and polish. For
      more complex designs, our process will often
      involve meeting in-person and sketching (e.g.
      on ipcharts) for rapid communication, clarity
      and feedback. Subsequent designs will be
      created in design software, data visualization
      software, and/or code â€“ becoming
      increasingly polished with each iteration.
      Final products are carefully checked for
      adherence to requirements and data
      accuracy.</p>
