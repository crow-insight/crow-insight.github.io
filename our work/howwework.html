      <p>Great performances in sports or theater don’t happen without the team’s behind-the-scenes preparation. Making information shine takes a similar commitment. Through structured discussions with our client’s team, we explain information design principles, inquiring and collaborating to define and prioritize requirements of the work. We explore a variety of topics, including audience, purpose, design principles, products and product characteristics.  The requirements resulting from these discussions are a touchstone throughout the next phase, guiding development and helping us evaluate success.</p>
