      <h2>Develop Deeper Understanding</h2>
      <p>We strive to ensure that we have a deep
        understanding of the context, information,
        data and messages that need to be
        communicated. Shortly after project start,
        in preparation for a kickoff meeting, we will
        begin working with the project liaison to
        gather and review all needed information.
        We will identify and communicate essential
        questions to the project liaison and/or the
        project team and experts.</p>

      <h2>Design, Iterate, & Polish</h2>
      <p>Depending upon the design complexity
        involved, each product will involve various
        steps of design, iteration, and polish. For
        more complex designs, our process will often
        involve meeting in-person and sketching (e.g.
        on ipcharts) for rapid communication, clarity
        and feedback. Subsequent designs will be
        created in design software, data visualization
        software, and/or code â€“ becoming
        increasingly polished with each iteration.
        Final products are carefully checked for
        adherence to requirements and data
        accuracy.</p>
