        <p style=" margin-top: 20px;">"We strive to ensure that we have a deep
understanding of the context, information,
data and messages that need to be
communicated. Shortly after project start,
in preparation for a kickoff meeting, we will
begin working with the project liaison to
gather and review all needed information.
We will identify and communicate essential
questions to the project liaison and/or the
project team and experts.</p>

        <p style=" margin-top: 20px;">"Depending upon the design complexity
involved, each product will involve various
steps of design, iteration, and polish. For
more complex designs, our process will often
involve meeting in-person and sketching (e.g.
on ipcharts) for rapid communication, clarity
and feedback. Subsequent designs will be
created in design software, data visualization
software, and/or code â€“ becoming
increasingly polished with each iteration.
Final products are carefully checked for
adherence to requirements and data
accuracy.</p>
