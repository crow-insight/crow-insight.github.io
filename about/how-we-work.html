      <p>Through structured discussions with our client’s team, we explain information design principles, inquiring and collaborating to define and prioritize requirements of the work. We explore a variety of topics, including <span class="definition" definition="Who will be reading the data story or using the dashboard?">audience</span>, <span class="definition" definition="What does the audience need to understand? What should users be able to do?">purpose</span>, <span class="definition" definition="Should data visualizations enable precise and independent analysis? Or amplify a message? Should it fit a particular look-and-feel?">design principles</span>, <span class="definition" definition="Is the goal best met by a data story? A dashboard? A presentation? An explanatory illustration?">products</span> and <span class="definition" definition="What kind of device or medium will be used to interact with the information? Do we need to protect sensitive or private data?">product characteristics</span>. The resulting requirements guide product development and help us evaluate success.</p>

      <p>We typically start with sketches to share ideas and generate feedback in a timely fashion. Subsequent designs are created using software or code – becoming increasingly polished with each iteration.  Final products are carefully checked for accuracy and adherence to requirements.</p>
